For 2018 we are going to start with unity tutorials from catlike coding, pretty awesome.
Also interspersed with js30 need to complete that...

Day 1: Remake the clock -
time - 2.15
Well I started it here and it seemed a good place to start, learned a few things about the unity interface and C# coding, also had to install and reinstall unity a few times to make it work correctly.  The things that make C Sharp unique are it's ability to keep things in their place.  The possibility that a number might become a string is almost non-existent and the thought that that process could extend even further is not possible either.

It's very different working with strongly typed language but it's nice to have the walls to bound the process.  Every language I learn I see where things got stolen from to make javascript what it is...

Day 2: Build the graph -
time - 1.45
Alright this was pretty cool, working a bit with some shader code, building a plot with math, the sine function seems very simple in it's mathematical basis, but once you start breaking it down and explaining it to the computer, it is a mess.  Fortunately this is a well written set of steps to follow.

Day 3: Make the graph multi -
time - 1:25
Now you can switch between a single sine wave and a multiple sine wave which is pretty cool, I see where this is going but I am having trouble following some of the steps, looks like it is time to start math khan academy again.

Day 4: Next steps multi -
time - 1.35
Now you have this `enum` which seems to be a form building type of function allow you to choose between different states in a way that informs those states.  It is a bridge I think to the next step.

day 6: This was a short stint and some messing with the camera, also slowing down to understand some of the math I’m writing which is simple and elegant…  One thing I like about math, although it has a tendency to oversimplify everything, it sure does get the basic idea.  :slightly_smiling_face:

a ripple, give it a minute I ramped up the voxel resolution:  https://hidden-dusk-36954.herokuapp.com/fun-graph/

Day 7:   Quick refactor, got lost in the maths again, using vector3's now but everything looks pretty much the same, getting ready to reference for 3d options, going to finish this up tomorrow then spend some time creating a smart contract in the eth blockchain, because that’s a thing.

Day 8: Mesh Networks Day, Part 3 -
time - 1.35
Running away from blockchain a bit, sometime the running will turn the other way.

Day 9, yesterday:
I finished out some more mathing in unity, need to package it up and build everything out then make some stuff happen in the front end so that it’s not just a hello world.  Also got nginx hosting multiple sites on digital ocean, but still fight some errors…


Day 10:  I made anotha shape!

day 11:  I couldn’t do it, was saving my off day for saturday, but it wasn’t happening, feel asleep as soon as I got home.

day 12:
time - 1.8
Researching a very poorly worded SO question I discovered discord.js that allows you to interact with the discord server.  I’m not completely sure what that is, seems to be some sort of gaming community, anyways I built a bot, it’s called Potluck of the Minds, because that’s what should up in my autocomplete…  I signed it into a server I created, if you say ping to it it responds Pong!

Day 13:  
time - 2.2
so building bots is super fun went with a pretty simple example on the next try here and now my bot returns a query from wikipedia, it has to be worded pretty exactly, but it works out alright and it’s got some error logging.  you’ll have to sign up for a discord account:  https://discord.gg/BUpK32
think the link is only good for a day, use +wikiq and then the query that has to be title case, i.e. San Francisco  full command : `+wikiq San Francisco`

Day 14:
time - 1.2
added a quote command to my bot also added some memory data stores…  need to refocus though and build some blockchain stuff, etc (edited)

Day 15:
time - 2.5
sometimes coding is a sad time, mesh networks attempt number 2 is a fail, built it out downloaded packages, seemed like success and then sadness reigns, next cnc we start a PWA and maybe a mapping util.

Day 16:
time - 1.2
This slow stepping into the blockchain space is difficult.  Every little step is very esoteric.  Running on the test network seems to do pretty well, but transporting eth to the EtherBase wallet and pushing the code up is another beast. Ethereum seemed like an easy way to go, but like some network is a little touchy until you get the hang of it I guess…  Posted my contract up to the test network went fine, but then tried to get things into the real network, did not go so well…   not even sure what I did wrong.  the struggle there may continue for some time.  These are dark days Must sleep though, so tired.  I feel like I should make journal entries like I’m living on mars or something….

Day 17:
time - 1.2
Did a little scripting with headless chromium and puppeteer, very cool stuff.  If the form is till around you can run the script if you drop your email and password into the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ed42311/613b3bb3d7401ceaa80d6ccd2fa99a22)

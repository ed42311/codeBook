# 100 days of code

### Day 1 - 6/5/2018

Cprogramming, talking about pointers in c. Pointers are onfusing but it sounds like they are a slippery type of storage, allowing you to channel inforamation just about anywhere in you computer.  If you look at the concept of a tunnel as if the tunnel holds the value and also is the value, it can be transfered our reassigned, but does not necessary stay constant, except in physical space as it is a pointer to the physical space of the computer itself.
